1. To open python shell -> enter (python or python3 in mac) -> press enter (python shell now live in terminal)

2. To exit -> ctrl + D (terminates) or ctrl + z (suspend) 

3. you can use this python shell.. to run small python code

// Module
1. module is nothing but other written code.. that we import and use

2. for known module like os and others.. python knows where it import it from... so no need to mention the from, just use "import os"

3. After each change in a module code, the module importing file.. doesn't know about that. It need to reload.. which can be done using a module for reload too. 


quick note: 
- variable -> attribute
- undefine error -> name error
- after enter -> press tab for proper identation
