1. Immutable
If a data type is immutable.. that means, we can't change anything in the thing it is refrencing to in the memory. But we can chnage the refrence itself. 
 
- example: string is immutable in python
        a = "hello"  // a refrence to a object in memory with data "hello"
        a = "world"  // changing refrence to a new object in memory
        a[0] = h    // Error, string is immutable
